# Given: list of integers/floats with lambda function as one of the element inside list
# Write function that will produce new list by applying lambda to all integers and floats
# Input: [lambda a: a + 2, 9, 3, 1, 0]
# Output: [11, 5, 3, 2]

# Input: [9, 2, 3, lambda a: a / 2.0, 1, 0]
# Output: [4.5, 1, 1.5, 0.5, 0.0]
