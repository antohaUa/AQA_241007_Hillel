# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept
# of "objects", which can contain data and code.
# The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
# and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).


# Vehicle
# ----------------
# wheel_num
# model
# year
# eng_vol

# Motorbike
# wheel_num = 2
# model = Suzuki
# year = 2022
# eng_vol = 1L

#############################################
# data ( properties)
# methods ( actions)


# abstraction
# create object with minimal data/methods that will satisfy certain requirements.
# work with objects on high levels without implementation details


# incapsulation

# inheritance   # don't repeat yourself DRY
#-----------------
# Figure  -> color, coordinates
# def draw
#-----------------

#-----------------
# Rectangle  -> color, coordinates
# def draw
#-----------------
#-----------------
# Circle  -> color, coordinates
# def draw
#-----------------


# Polymorphism
# For example, objects of type Circle and Rectangle are derived from a common
# class called Figure. The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary
# to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.
