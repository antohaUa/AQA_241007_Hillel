Cursor:
In the context of databases, a cursor is an object used to interact with the database.
It acts as a control structure that allows you to:

Execute SQL Queries: Send SQL commands (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the database.
Retrieve Data: Fetch query results in a structured way, such as row by row or all at once.
Navigate Through Results: Move through the records of a result set, especially in SELECT queries.

Key Features
Lifecycle: A cursor is tied to a connection. When the connection is closed, the cursor is no longer usable.
Scoped Resources: Using with ensures the cursor is properly closed after use.
Multiple Cursors: You can have multiple cursors open at the same time for different queries or tasks.

Why Use a Cursor?
Separation: Keeps the query execution logic separate from the connection.
Performance: Efficiently fetch large datasets in manageable chunks (fetchone, fetchmany).
Flexibility: Supports prepared statements, parameterized queries, and navigation through results.
